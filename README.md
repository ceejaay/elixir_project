Followed a [Udemy tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial/learn/lecture/5427948#overview) to build Identicons. Those geometric JPGs that you see as avatars on some sites.
Provides an overview of Elixir's functional nature. Introduces structs and immutibility.
